This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is currently `null` or `undefined`.  It's especially common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components haven't fully mounted yet.

```javascript
// Example: Accessing a property before data has loaded

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('someAPI')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setData(data));
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{data.name}</Text> //Error here if data is still null
    </View>
  );
};
```
